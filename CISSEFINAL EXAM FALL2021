#For this exam we will use a new (to you) dataset, an update of NHIS. We’ll look at estimates of whether people worked for an employer that offered health insurance, EMPHI. The data is available on Slack. (Note that in data, NIU is “Not in Universe” so for instance if people are asked if their employer offers health insurance then somebody not working would be NIU.)
